### Interfaces.....
 Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritances with classes, hybrid inheritance involving multiple inheritance is also not possible with classes. In Java, we can achieve hybrid inheritance only through Interfaces if we want to involve multiple inheritance to implement Hybrid inheritance.
However, it is important to note that Hybrid inheritance does not necessarily require the use of Multiple Inheritance exclusively. It can be achieved through a combination of Multilevel Inheritance and Hierarchical Inheritance with classes, Hierarchical and Single Inheritance with classes. Therefore, it is indeed possible to implement Hybrid inheritance using classes alone, without relying on multiple inheritance type.
